Lecture-7 Express
1-Adding Expres to the app.
Express application variables.
app.get reads the property. 
and app.set that defines the property of the application.
2-Making the app.listen method an asynchronous code by adding a callback.
3-The app.listen method returns an object which we can use to access
various properties of the server such as the port. To do this we
assign the method to a variable called var server.
var port = server.address().port;
