How to get data from Query strings.
Using offset and count as parameters in query strings to extract the number of hotels.
Finally we see how the query string data inside the controller is used to manipulate the data that is coming out of the server.
Query strings are often used in a GET METHOD  to send data into the server.
When query strings are used in a POST METHOD they can help in adding data to the body of request.

BodyParser
Unlike queey strings EXPRESS cannot deal with posted forms, so we need a middleware called
BodyParser. We need to install this first.
npm install --save body-parser.
require it in app.js.
The order in which it is put is important so it has to inbetween the static path and where
we define the routes. This is to make sure the middleware runs before any API's run.
See how to add a new item or hotel name using the POST method and test it in the POSTMAN
app.

You can run the nodemon only in the parent folder and not sub-folders, just like app.js.
