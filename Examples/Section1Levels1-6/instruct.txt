1-node --version
(installs node v4.1.2)
(it installed v6.11.2)
2- with node we also get a package manager called npm.
3- to ensure this type npm --version.(3.10.10).
4- to type in commands we need a node shell. So to initiate the shell
type node
5-require and module.exports(require is part of node and it will load other
scripts)
syntax- require('./Name of the file'); to specify the path and no .js extentsion is needed.

6-how to expose a method and call it in the require module. Create a new 
folder called talk.
To do this create a file called goodbye.js under the talk folder
and have a console.log inside the module.exports function and call then
call it inside the app.js file.
var goodbye = require('./talk/goodbye');
7- another way of exposing the method in app.js.
