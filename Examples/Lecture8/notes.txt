Lecture-8 Defining url routes and sending response.
We are using the Http get.method to chain our express app to specify the 
path we are going to listen for and a function that we are going to run 
when the route is being matched.
2-HTTP status codes.
res.send have a set of status codes that gets returned from the server by express by default
To change it we have to set the res.status(404)in the app.get http method
inside the function.
3-Sending a Json response.
While building an API we want to send some data which is json basically.
For this we have to update the home route by adding another route.
4-Returning static files.
REquire path module and specify the path in the res.send of the route.
First we return the app.js file to the browser from the /file route.
Next we return the html file from the public folder by modifying the
home route.
